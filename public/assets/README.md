# Game assets (placeholders)

Placeholder images for buildings. Replace with your own art when ready.

- **house.png** – House building (56×56 + padding).
- **shop.png** – Shop building (for future use).

Generated by: `node scripts/generate-placeholders.mjs`

To replace: overwrite these PNGs or add new ones and reference them in the game (e.g. in `src/game/ecs/components.ts` and the Phaser scene).
